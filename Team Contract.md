# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our group will meet once a week and each meeting will last around an hour. No software or tool will be used since we will meet at Grainger Library. Everybody will take notes during the meeting.
2. **Assistance** 
    We will use WeChat/discord to contact each other, and we expect our team members to respond within an hour.
3. **Respect** 
    We will have a free discussion period during each meeting and everyone can express their opinions during this time period. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    We will distribute work according to the amount of time each group member can allocate to this project and their strengths. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
    3-4 hours of work per week is expected of each group member. If there are new time conflicts, we will host a short emergent meeting to discuss the issue together.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If any of these situations happen, we will first try to hold a short online meeting to discuss the issue together or just discuss it in our group chat. In order to avoid the situations listed above, we will try our best to reach an agreement at every meeting.
